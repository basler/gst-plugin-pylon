# gst-plugin-pylon

> The official GStreamer source plug-in for Basler cameras powered by Basler pylon Camera Software Suite


This plugin allows to use any Basler 2D camera (supported by Basler pylon Camera Software Suite) as source element in a GStreamer pipeline.

All camera features are available in the plugin by dynamic runtime mapping to gstreamer properties.

**Please Note:**
This project is offered with no technical support by Basler AG.
You are welcome to post any questions or issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/basler/gst-plugin-pylon).

[![CI](https://github.com/basler/gst-plugin-pylon/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/basler/gst-plugin-pylon/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The next chapters describe how to [use](#getting-started) and [build](#Building) the *pylonsrc* plugin.

# Getting started 

To display the video stream of a single Basler camera is as simple as:

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

The following sections describe how to select and configure the camera.

## Camera selection
If only a single camera is connected to the system, `pylonsrc` will use this camera without any further actions required.

If more than one camera is connected, you have to select the camera.
Cameras can be selected via index, serial-number or device-user-name

If no selection is given `pylonsrc` will show an error message which will list the available cameras. The list contains the serial number, the device model name and if set the user defined name of each camera.

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc ! fakesink
Setting pipeline to PAUSED ...
ERROR: Pipeline doesnt want to pause.
ERROR: from element /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstPylonSrc:pylonsrc0: Failed to start camera.
Additional debug info:
../ext/pylon/gstpylonsrc.c(524): gst_pylon_src_start (): /GstPipeline:pipeline0/GstPylonSrc:pylonsrc0:
At least 4 devices match the specified criteria, use "device-index", "device-serial-number" or "device-user-name" to select one from the following list:
[0]: 21656705   acA1920-155uc   top-left
[1]: 0815-0000  Emulation
[2]: 0815-0001  Emulation
[3]: 0815-0002  Emulation
```

### examples
select second camera from list:

` gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc device-index=1 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

select camera with serial number `21656705`

` gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc device-serial-number="21656705" ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

select camera with user name `top-left`

` gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc device-user-name="top-left" ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

## Configuring the camera

The configuration of the camera is defined by
* gstreamer pipeline capabilities
* the active UserSet or supplied PFS file
* feature properties of the plugin 

### Capabilities

The pixel format, image width, image height and acquisition framerate ( FPS ) are set during capability negotiation.


#### examples

configuring to 640x480 @ 10fps in Mono8 format:

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc ! "video/x-raw,width=640,height=480,framerate=10/1,format=GRAY8"  ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

configuring to 640x480 @ 10fps in BayerRG8 format:

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc ! "video/x-bayer,width=640,height=480,framerate=10/1,format=rggb" ! bayer2rgb ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

**Important:** The **bayer2rgb** element does not process non 4 byte aligned bayer formats correctly. If no size is specified (or a range is provided) a word aligned width will be automatically selected. If the width is hardcoded and it is not word aligned, the pipeline will fail displaying an error.

#### Pixel format definitions

For the pixel format check the format supported for your camera on https://docs.baslerweb.com/pixel-format

The mapping of the camera pixel format names to the gstreamer format names is:

|Pylon              | GStreamer  |
|-------------------|:----------:|
| Mono8             |  GRAY8     |
| RGB8Packed        |  RGB       |
| RGB8              |  RGB       |
| BGR8Packed        |  BGR       |
| BGR8              |  BGR       |
| YCbCr422_8        |  YUY2      |
| YUV422_8          |  YUY2      |
| YUV422_YUYV_Packed|  YUY2      |
| YUV422_8_UYVY     |  UYVY      |
| YUV422Packed      |  UYVY      |
| BayerBG8          |  bggr      |
| BayerGR8          |  grbg      |
| BayerRG8          |  rggb      |
| BayerGB8          |  gbrg      |

### Fixation 

If two pipeline elements don't specify which capabilities to choose, a fixation step gets applied.

This could result in an unexpected pixel format or width/height.

It is recommended to set a caps-filter to explicitly set the wanted capabilities.

### Handle capture errors

`pylonsrc` lets you decide what to do when a capture error happens.

This feature is controlled by the enumeration property `capture-error`. You can choose one of the following options:

* **keep:** Use the partial or corrupted buffers.
* **skip:** Skip the partial or corrupted buffers. A maximum of 100 buffers can be skipped before the pipeline aborts
* **abort:** Stop pipeline in case of any capture error.

If this property is not set, the default behavior is the `abort` option, meaning that the element will fail to process the buffer and it will post a fatal error to the bus.

As an example, the following pipeline will skip corrupted or partial buffers:

```
gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc capture-error=skip ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

### UserSet handling

`pylonsrc` always loads a UserSet of the camera before applying any further properties. 

This feature is controlled by the enumeration property `user-set`.

If this property is not set, or set to the value `Auto`, the power-on UserSet gets loaded. How to select another power-on default is documented for [UserSetDefault](https://docs.baslerweb.com/user-sets#choosing-a-startup-set) feature.

To select dynamically another UserSet the `user-set` property accepts any other implemented UserSet of the camera.

e.g to activate the `UserSet1` UserSet on a Basler ace camera:

```
gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc user-set=UserSet1 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

Overall UserSets topics for the camera are documented in [Chapter UserSets](https://docs.baslerweb.com/user-sets) in the Basler product documentation.

### PFS file

`pylonsrc` can load a custom configuration from a PFS file. A PFS file is a file with previously saved settings of camera features.

This feature is controlled by the property `pfs-location`.

To use a PFS file, specify the filepath using the `pfs-location` property.

e.g to use a PFS file with name `example-file-name.pfs` on a Basler ace camera:

```
gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc pfs-location=example-file-name.pfs ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

**Important:** Using this property will result in overriding the camera features set by the `user-set` property if also specified.

An example on how to generate PFS files using pylon Viewer is documented in [Chapter Overview of the pylon Viewer](https://docs.baslerweb.com/overview-of-the-pylon-viewer#camera-menu) in the Basler product documentation.

### Features

After applying the UserSet, the optional PFS file and the gstreamer properties, any other camera feature gets applied.

The `pylonsrc` plugin dynamically exposes all features of the camera as gstreamer [child properties](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gstreamer/gstchildproxy.html?gi-language=c) with the prefix `cam::` and all stream grabber parameters with the prefix `stream::`

Pylon features like `ExposureTime` or `Gain` are mapped to the gstreamer properties `cam::ExposureTime` and `cam::Gain`.

Examples to set Exposuretime to 2000Âµs and Gain to 10.3dB

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc cam::ExposureTime=2000 cam::Gain=10.3 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

Pylon stream grabber parameters like MaxTransferSize or MaxNumBuffer are mapped to the gstreamer properties `stream::MaxTransferSize` and `stream::MaxNumBuffer`.

Example to set MaxTransferSize to 4MB and MaxNumBuffer to 10 on an USB3Vision camera

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc stream::MaxTransferSize=4194304 stream::MaxNumBuffer=10 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

All available features can be listed by by calling

`gst-inspect-1.0 pylonsrc`

### Selected Features

Some of the camera features are not directly available but have to be selected first.

As an example the feature `TriggerSource` has to be selected by `TriggerSelector` first. ( see [TriggerSource](https://docs.baslerweb.com/trigger-source) in the Basler product documentation)

These two steps ( select and access ) are mapped to `pylonsrc` properties as a single step with this pattern

`cam::<featurename>-<selectorvalue>`

For the above  `TriggerSource` example if  the `TriggerSource` of the trigger `FrameStart` has to be configured the property is:

`cam::TriggerSource-FrameStart`

Example:
Configure a hardware trigger on Line1 for the trigger FrameStart:

`gst-launch-1.0 pylonsrc cam::TriggerSource-FrameStart=Line1 cam::TriggerMode-FrameStart=On ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`


# Building

This plugin is build using the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system. The meson version has to be >= 0.61.

As a first step install Basler pylon according to your platform. Downloads are available at: [Basler software downloads](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/downloads/software-downloads/#type=pylonsoftware;language=all;version=all)

The supported pylon versions on the different platforms are:


|                 | 7.1  | 6.2  |
|-----------------|:----:|:----:|
| Windows x86_64  |   x  |      |
| Linux x86_64    |   x  |      |
| Linux aarch64   |   x  |   x  |
| macOS x86_64    |   -  |      |


> macOS build not available for now due to current meson/cmake interaction issues

Installing Basler pylon SDK will also install the Basler pylon viewer. You should use this tool to verify, that the cameras work properly in your system and to learn about the their features.

The differences in the build steps for [Linux](#Linux), [Windows](#Windows) and [macos](#macOS) are described in the next sections.

## Linux
Make sure the dependencies are properly installed. In Debian-based
systems you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Meson and ninja build system
# Remove older meson and ninja from APT and install newer PIP version
sudo apt remove meson ninja-build
sudo -H python3 -m pip install meson ninja --upgrade

# GStreamer
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev cmake
```

The build process relies on `PYLON_ROOT` pointing to the Basler pylon install directory.

```bash
# for pylon in default location
export PYLON_ROOT=/opt/pylon
```

Then proceed to configure the project. Check `meson_options.txt` for a
list of configuration options. On Debian-based systems, make sure you
configure the project as:

```bash
meson builddir --prefix /usr/
```

Build, test and install the project:

```bash
# Build
ninja -C builddir

# Test
ninja -C builddir test

# Install
sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

Finally, test for proper installation:

```bash
gst-inspect-1.0 pylonsrc
```

### Integrating with GStreamer monorepo

The monorepo is a top-level repository that integrates and builds all
GStreamer subprojects (core, plugins, docs, etc...). It is the
recommended way of building GStreamer from source, test different
versions without installing them and even contribute code in the form
of Merge Requests. The monorepo was released starting with GStreamer
1.20 stable release.

GstPluginPylon can integrate seamlessly with GStreamer's monorepo. To
do so run the following commands:

1. Clone the monorepo branch you wish to test. For example 1.20:
```
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer -b 1.20
cd gstreamer
```

2. Clone gst-plugin-pylon into the subprojects directory:
```
cd subprojects/
git clone https://github.com/basler/gst-plugin-pylon
cd -
```

3. Configure and build as usual, specifying the custom subproject:
```
PYLON_ROOT=/opt/pylon meson builddir --prefix /usr -Dcustom_subprojects=gst-plugin-pylon
ninja -C builddir
```

4. Test the uninstalled environment:
```
ninja -C builddir devenv
```
This will open a new shell with the evironment configured to load GStreamer from this build.
```
gst-inspect-1.0 pylonsrc
```
Type `exit` to return to the normal shell.

Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer/blob/main/README.md)
for instructions on how to customize the monorepo build.

### Maintainer configuration

If you are a maintainer or plan to extend the plug-in, we recommend
the following configuration:

```
meson builddir --prefix /usr/ --werror --buildtype=debug -Dgobject-cast-checks=enabled -Dglib-asserts=enabled -Dglib-checks=enabled
```

### Cross compilation for linux targets
#### NVIDIA Jetson Jetpack
TBD

#### YOCTO recipe
TBD
A yocto recipe will be provided in  [meta-basler-tools](https://github.com/basler/meta-basler-tools) layer on github.

## Windows
Install the dependencies:

GStreamer:
* Install the gstreamer runtimeÂ **and**Â development packages ( using the files forÂ MSVC 64-bit (VS 2019, Release CRT ) from [https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/)
* use latest version.

Meson:
* Install the meson build system from github releases https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases
* Use version meson-0.63.1-64.msi

Visual Studio:
* Install Visual Studio (e.g. Community Edition) from Microsoft
* Select desktop development (C++) package within installer

The following commands should be run from aÂ *Visual Studio command prompt*. The description below doesn't work for powershell.

Specify the path to pkgconfig configuration files for GStreamer and the pkg-config binary ( shipped as part ofÂ gstreamer development )

```bash
set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64%lib\pkgconfig
set PATH=%PATH%;%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64%\bin
```

The build process relies on CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH pointing to Basler pylon cmake support files. This is normally set by the Basler pylon installer.
```bash
set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Program Files\Basler\pylon 7\Development\CMake\pylon\
```


Then the plugin can be compiled and installed using Ninja:

```
meson build --prefix=%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64%
ninja -C build
```

Or made available as a Visual Studio project:

```
meson build --prefix=%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64% --backend=vs2022
```

This will generate a Visual Studio solution in the build directory

To test without install:

```
set GST_PLUGIN_PATH=build/ext/pylon  

%GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64%\bin\gst-launch-1.0.exe 

pylonsrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink  
```

To install into main gstreamer directory

```
ninja -C build install
```

>Workaround for running from normal cmdshell in a non US locale: 
>As visual studio currently ships a broken vswhere.exe tool, that meson relies on.  
Install a current vswhere.exe fromÂ [Releases Â· microsoft/vswhere Â· GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere/releases)Â that fixes (Â [Initialize console after parsing arguments by heaths Â· Pull Request #263 Â· microsoft/vswhere Â· GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere/pull/263)Â )


Finally, test for proper installation:

```bash
gst-inspect-1.0 pylonsrc
```

## macOS
Installation on macOS is currently not supported due to conflicts between meson and underlying cmake in the configuration phase.

This target will be integrated after a Basler pylon 7.x release for macOS

# Known issues
* Due to an issue in the pipeline parser typos and unsupported feature names are silently ignored. We work on providing an upstream fix to provide full error reporting capability in the pipeline parser.

* Bayer formats need to be 4 byte aligned to be properly processed by GStreamer. If no size is specified (or a range is provided) a word aligned width will be automatically selected. If the width is hardcoded and it is not word aligned, the pipeline will fail displaying an error.
